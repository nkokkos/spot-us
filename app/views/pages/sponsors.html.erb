  <h3>Spot.Us Sponsorships</h3>
  <p>Spot.Us isn't possible without support from community members who give as little as $2 and
  as much as $2,000. <a href="http://spot.us/contributors">View the list of small donors on our
  community page</a>.</p>
  <p>Spot.Us also has a unique approach toward corporate underwriting and sponsorship that we
  believe is of more value than traditional advertising.</p>
  <p>Community members unlock sponsorship funds by engaging with your brand, product or
  cause. Then they get to choose where the funds go. You create value for them and in exchange, they'll create value for you; providing feedback or taking the time to learn more about your brand, product or cause.</p>
  <p>It's real engagement. They may even thank you for it!</p>
  <p>From a community member: "This is one of the best advertising experiences I’ve ever had. I gave something of what I know, I got something of what they wanted me to know, and I gave the resulting spot $ to a story I wanted to support."</p>
