Dear <%=@user.first_name%>,

Welcome to Spot.Us and thanks for joining our effort to produce
community powered reporting.

You can login here: http://spot.us/session/new

In the meantime, here are some ideas on how to get started:

1. Start a pitch:  Traditionally you would pitch editors, because they
were the only people that had a freelance budget.  At Spot.Us community
members band together to build a budget of their own.  Now you can pitch
the public to do the journalism you want! 

Here are answers to some FAQ's

We are very hands on and passionate about making sure that the
information needs of our communities are met.  We work for you!!!!

Donâ€™t hesitate to contact us:  info@spot.us

Sincerely,
David Cohn
